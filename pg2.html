      An expanded Peer Leadership program supports peer mediation, new student orientation, and the ninth grade transition project. The school chapters of Octagon and the Junior State of America (JSA) provide students with an opportunity to study and become involved with political issues on the local, national, and international scenes. The FFA Chapter, transferred to this school from Freehold High School in 1972, is the oldest chapter in the State of New Jersey. All of the clubs, student publications, organizations and societies that exist form part of the student activity program and combine with the excellent academic program of the school and district, to define the total curriculum at Freehold Township High School.

      We had notable success off the field as well: five members of our choir were named to the All-Shore Chorus and two were named All-State. Twenty members of our band earned All-Shore honors, while we had one All-Region band honoree and one All-State band member. We once again had county, regional, state or national accomplishments by participants in FCCLA, Consumer Bowl, Forensics, FFA, Drama, Art Club, and Newspaper. The Red Cross Club continued its community outreach by sponsoring two blood drives at the school. Students at Freehold Township participate in a well-rounded extracurricular program.
      
      The Freehold Township High School Patriot Parent-Teacher Organization (PTO) is the umbrella parent organization for the school. The PTO contributes to the total educational community, promoting student success, and honoring student achievements in many different ways. Recognition awards, the presentation of seven annual scholarships, mini-grants to teachers, and the donation of equipment and services are just some of the ways in which parents have actively supported the total school program. Parental involvement is both valued and encouraged. Under the auspices of the PTO, The Principal’s Advisory Committee, The Music Parents Association, The Football Parents’ Club, The Wrestling Parents, The Lacrosse Parents, and other special interest groups formed to support specific student activities.
      
      The Patriot school community is committed to providing unique and challenging educational opportunities for each student. A variety of instructional settings, classroom arrangements, teaching styles, assessment strategies, and student activities are utilized to make this goal attainable. An enthusiastic and supportive community, ongoing curriculum revision and expansion, meaningful staff development, and other educational initiatives combine to foster and create a challenging and dynamic educational program for all at Freehold Township High School.</h1>
